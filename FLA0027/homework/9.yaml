  2014-04-22 23:39:43 Stella__ haha, I mean Cindy and I use the same brand of our cellphones, Nora. Could you tell me why you choose Apple?
  2014-04-22 23:17:10 Stella__ Hey, good evening, Cindy.
  2014-04-22 23:55:18 Stella__ Hi, Jack.
  2014-04-22 23:24:20 Stella__ Hi, May.
  2014-04-22 23:59:12 Stella__ I also agree on Cindy's opinions.
  2014-04-22 23:30:51 Stella__ I also agree with you, Cindy, but I seldom use keeping accounts apps. I usually use the app combinating with many kinds of tools such as map, tour guide, and train timetable. 
  2014-04-23 00:12:45 Stella__ I am too tired to concentrate on our conversation. I think I had better go to bed now. Hey, sleep early guys. Good night, see you tomorrow.
  2014-04-22 23:46:57 Stella__ If I could afford it, I would consider it. haha..

  2014-04-22 23:57:28 Stella__ I think it depends on what things you want to do on that moment. How about you?
  2014-04-22 23:46:04 Stella__ Mmm.. Actually, I don't have any ideas about it because I don't have extra money to buy a new smartphone.
  2014-04-22 23:50:02 Stella__ Right, the design from Apple is sample but elaborate, Nora.
  2014-04-22 23:19:35 Stella__ So sad. Maybe we can chat together. That will be fine.
  2014-04-23 00:13:54 Stella__ Thanks. You, too. Bye~
  2014-04-22 23:55:07 Stella__ The frequency I use computer now is much less than before because I can also do many things with smartphones if I do not have the computer.
  2014-04-22 23:23:19 Stella__ Well, Cindy, what kinds of apps do you recommend or you think more useful?
  2014-04-23 00:01:49 Stella__ Well, Jack, your question is really great. We have to think about it.
  2014-04-22 23:33:55 Stella__ Which brand of your smartphone do you use now, guys? Samsung? Apple? Or HTC?
  2014-04-22 23:35:05 Stella__ Wow, we are the same.

  2014-04-23 23:57:22 Yrral if your object is moving or shaking you can use shorter shutter time to freeze the moment you want to record
  2014-04-23 23:43:24 Yrral it means you can control the depth of field directly through out controlling the size of you aperture
  2014-04-23 23:40:27 Yrral I use A mode most, A for Aperture
  2014-04-24 00:18:38 Yrral Miaoli is usually humid, you should put your DSLR in a dry cabinet

  2014-04-24 00:19:44 Yrral that all
  2014-04-23 23:55:03 Yrral Tv = S mode means shutter priority or time value
