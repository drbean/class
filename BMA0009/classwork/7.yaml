     In which of these 2 replies to the p51 invitation is the tone better? Remember the prof is writing to a student.

      First letter:

      Dear Jessica

      Thank you for inviting me to be a guest at your 40th Anniversary reception at International Conference Hall, National United University. I am glad to have been given such an invitation.

      Usually, I would be pleased to accept your invitation. Unfortunately, due to a prior commitment, I might decline your invitation.

      Please accept my apology for not being able to join your reception. I wish the reception will be successful, and hope that I can join next time.

      Sincerely                  

      Professor Chang

      Second letter:

      Dear Stella Fong,

      Thank you for inviting me to the 40th Anniversary Reception.

      I really want to share my stories to every student. Unfortunately, I can’t take part in the reception because I have to attend a conference on November 24, I think I might decline your invitation.

      I am sorry about that I can’t join in. If I have the opportunity to join the reception next year, I must promise your invitation. I hope this reception will successfully conduct.
