    # Dear Mr. Bean,
    # 
    # As you may be aware ,the weather was not good for few days. As usual ,I walked to home and it rained suddenly. I got wet because I didn’t bring any umbrella. So, I have a cold .
    # 
    # After treatment , I often feel a bit sleepy and I don’t feel well. Therefore, I must absent the class every week until I feel well.
    # 
    # About the class, I will keep reading the book and studying for it. As much as possible, I will follow the schedule every week and do the homework.
    # 
    # Hope I can go to back to the class soon.
    # 
    # Sincerely,
    #

    # Dear Dr. Bean, 
    # 
    # You may know that, the weather is cold one minute and hot the next recently. Sometimes, it rained suddenly. The day before yesterday, when I was taking a walk nearby my home, it rained suddenly. I got wet because I didn’t bring an umbrella. So, I have a bad cold and I am full of catarrh.
    # 
    # With treatment, I often feel a bit sleepy and I don’t feel well. Therefore, I must absent the class every week until I feel well.
    # 
    # About the class, I will keep reading the book and ask my classmate for the latest note. As much as possible, I will follow the schedule every week and do the homework.
    # 
    # Hope I can get well soon and get back the class.
    # 
    # Sincerely,
    # 
    # Judy
